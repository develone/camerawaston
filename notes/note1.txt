The time that nut is where the camera is about 20 frames
This is out of 1799 frames on the test that I did with belt1.
This took several steps.
1. start the video on Rpi Zero with camera.
https://github.com/develone/camerawatson/blob/master/belt1/h264/belt.h264
2. convert the h264 to mp4 with MP4Box 
3. split h264 to frames with ffmpeg
4. Determine which frames have valid data
https://github.com/develone/camerawatson/tree/master/belt1/nut/frame
This has frame0064.bmp to frame0088.bmp
5. run svd in octave on RaspBian stretch 
https://github.com/develone/camerawatson/tree/master/belt1/ananut
Did svd on 5 frames
Need to work on the video file not the frames. 
Let me know if you understand these steps.
